# WebGL

## Patterns
- [drawArrays](webgl/drawArrays.html): Each triangle has got three independent vertices, each their own colour and rotation around the center of the triangle.
- [drawElements](webgl/drawElements.html): Each triangle is attached to other triangles by sharing vertices thanks to the index array (or *element array*).
- [drawArraysInstanced](webgl/drawArraysInstanced.html): Just two triangles of three vertices each, but instanced on the GPU to fill the screen and rotate around the diagonal.
Try to click on the surface! If you have got a keyboard, try to hold `Alt` while clicking, `Space` to invert the direction and the `P` key to pause.

## Cubes
(as seen on [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Creating_3D_objects_using_WebGL))
